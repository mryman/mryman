I have lived in Seattle for about 18 years, following stints in Alaska, Colorado, and my childhood home state of Ohio. During my time in the Pacific Northwest, I have done sporadic work as a technology professional with a focus on Network Administration and Desktop Support for small businesses.  This work supplemented my career in the adventure travel industry in Operations/Logistics management and as a professional mountain guide, which allowed me to work on all seven continents over a twelve year stretch.  I left that industry after the birth of my second daughter and I am excited about building a new skill set in the world of coding to open up future employment opportunities.
